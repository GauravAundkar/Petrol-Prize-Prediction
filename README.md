# Petrol-Prize-Prediction

This project is predicting petrol price based on dollar price and price of oil barrel. I have find out that linear regression model is giving the best result wiht dataset for predicting petrol price. The model will be trained with dataset having past history of petrol prices. Linear Regression is an ML algorithm used for supervised learning. Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable based on the given independent variable. So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between a dependent variable and the other given independent variables.
